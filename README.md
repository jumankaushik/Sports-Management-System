# Sports-Management-System

The Sports Management System is a computerized system that aims to streamline the sports management process in Hansraj College. This system allows for efficient management of the sports inventory and records of sports items issued by the sports authority of the college to students. It enables sports faculty to issue and return sports items digitally for students and removes the need for manual paperwork.
The system offers various features such as a user login system for students and staff, an inventory of sports items, and automatic fine calculation for students who fail to return items on time. It also provides an online interface for the admin to view details of sports items issued, issue and return time within a day, and a digital record of all the past issuance and returns.
The Sports Management System is designed to make the sports management process more efficient, convenient and error-free. By providing an automated solution, it minimizes the chances of manual errors and makes the process of sports item issuance and management more transparent. The system will be implemented using a linear and sequential approach, with each phase building on the previous one.
